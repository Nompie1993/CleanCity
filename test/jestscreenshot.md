**Document Automation Strategy and Results**

### **Automation Strategy**

- **Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library
- **Scope:** Covers form validation, accessibility, dashboard analytics, and critical user flows (pickup request, dashboard view)
- **Test Data:** Uses realistic user input and dashboard data
- **Execution:** Automated using npm test
- **Maintainability:** Tests are modular and map to user stories/flows

### **Results**

- All test suites pass, confirming that:
  - Form validation works for both empty and filled states
  - Dashboard renders all critical analytics and stats
  - Accessibility roles and labels are present
  - Critical user flows (pickup request, dashboard view) are functional

## **Sample Output:**

 PASS  src/tests/PickupRequest.test.js
 PASS  src/tests/DashboardView.test.js
 PASS  src/tests/HomeFormValidation.test.js
 PASS  src/tests/Dashboard.test.js
 PASS  src/tests/DashboardAccessibility.test.js

Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
Tests:       11 passed, 11 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.5 s
```
## **Sample Results Table:**

| Test Suite                    | Status  |
|-------------------------------|---------|
| HomeFormValidation.test.js    | Passed  |
| Dashboard.test.js             | Passed  |
| DashboardAccessibility.test.js| Passed  |
| PickupRequest.test.js| Passed  |
| DashboardView.test.js| Passed  |

**Summary:**  
- We have automated coverage for all critical user flows.
- Tests are executed automatically and results are tracked.
- The strategy ensures reliability and maintainability for CleanCityâ€™s QA process.
